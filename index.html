      <hi>About Me</h1>
<P>My name is Faith Ikhidero, I am committed to making a lifelong impact in the educational sector in Nigeria as my contribution to the SDG Goal 4: Quality Education.</p>
<p>As a young girl, I always looked out for things that were challenging. My motto has always been "There's a way, look closer, think harder"
<h2>My Mission</h2>
<p>I believe that every child has the right to basic primary and secondary education, I will continue to play my part in ensuring that there is no Nigerian child left without basic education. I also believe in gaining vocational education as a tool to be solely independent and earn a means of livelihood.</p>
